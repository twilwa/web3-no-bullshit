o achieve your goal of integrating scaffold-eth with your Avalanche L1 deployed on AWS and adding Thirdweb as a fiat on-ramp for USDC, here's a step-by-step approach:
Set up scaffold-eth for Avalanche:
First, you'll need to configure scaffold-eth to work with the Avalanche network. This involves updating the network configuration in your Hardhat config file. You'll need to add Avalanche's network details and ensure you have the correct RPC URL for your AWS-deployed Avalanche node.
Update this file to include Avalanche network configuration, pointing to your AWS-deployed node.
Deploy your smart contracts to Avalanche:
Use Hardhat to deploy your smart contracts to your Avalanche network. Make sure you have the correct private keys and network configuration set up.
Update the frontend to connect to Avalanche:
Modify your frontend code to connect to the Avalanche network. This typically involves updating the chain ID and RPC URL in your React components.
Integrate Thirdweb SDK:
To add Thirdweb as a fiat on-ramp for USDC, you'll need to integrate the Thirdweb SDK into your project. Start by installing the SDK:
Bash
Set up Thirdweb client:
Create a Thirdweb client in your application. You'll need to get an API key from Thirdweb's dashboard.
Implement USDC purchase with fiat:
Use Thirdweb's extensions to implement the USDC purchase functionality. You'll need to set up the USDC contract and create a function to handle the purchase.
Create a UI for USDC purchase:
Implement a user interface that allows users to input the amount of USDC they want to purchase and triggers the purchaseUSDC function.
Handle wallet connection:
Ensure your application can connect to the user's wallet. Scaffold-eth should already have this functionality, but you might need to adjust it for Avalanche.
Test thoroughly:
Test the entire flow, from connecting to the Avalanche network to purchasing USDC using Thirdweb's fiat on-ramp.
Deploy your updated application:
Once everything is working locally, deploy your updated application to your preferred hosting service.
This is a high-level overview of the steps you'll need to take. Each step may involve more detailed work depending on your specific setup and requirements. You might want to start by setting up scaffold-eth with Avalanche, and then move on to integrating Thirdweb for the USDC purchase functionality.
Remember to handle error cases, implement proper security measures, and follow best practices for handling financial transactions. Also, ensure you comply with all relevant regulations when implementing a fiat on-ramp.
I updated my foundry.toml with the RPC endpoint information, and I beleive I've got the necessary contracts deployed already (done before I started this project.) Which React components need to be updated? I notice that scaffold eth defaults to connecting to localhost, so I've modified scafffold.config.ts and added customChains.ts as described in the scaffold-eth docs already. 

DOCS PAGES
Great progress so far! You've taken the right steps by updating the foundry.toml with your RPC endpoint and modifying the scaffold.config.ts along with adding customChains.ts. Now, let's focus on updating the React components to connect to your Avalanche L1 network instead of localhost.
Here are the key areas you'll need to update:
packages/nextjs/components/scaffold-eth/RainbowKitCustomConnectButton.tsx:
This component handles the wallet connection. Make sure it's using the correct chain configuration.
packages/nextjs/pages/_app.tsx:
This is where the main app configuration happens, including setting up the wagmi client and chains.
packages/nextjs/utils/scaffold-eth/networks.ts:
This file defines the available networks. Ensure your Avalanche L1 network is properly defined here.
Any component that interacts with smart contracts or uses network-specific information.
Let's start with updating the _app.tsx file:
Next, update the RainbowKitCustomConnectButton.tsx:
For the networks.ts file, make sure your Avalanche L1 network is properly defined:
networks.ts
These changes should configure your app to connect to your Avalanche L1 network. Make sure to test the connection thoroughly, especially the wallet connection and any contract interactions.
For integrating Thirdweb as a fiat on-ramp for USDC, you'll need to:
Install the Thirdweb SDK:
Bash
Create a new component for the USDC purchase, for example USDCPurchase.tsx:
Add this component to your main page or wherever you want the USDC purchase functionality.
Remember, this is a basic setup. You'll need to implement the actual purchase logic using Thirdweb's SDK and your specific USDC contract on Avalanche. Also, ensure you're complying with all relevant regulations when implementing a fiat on-ramp.
@Dynamic is actually what we decided to go with instead of thirdweb. I'd like to use their embedded wallets feature with @Account Kit from Alchemy. I've got Dynamic set up for the most part, but their embedded wallets from the dashboard only support Zerodev abstracted wallets. What I'd like to do is use accountkit to create a Modular Account on signup, and allow a user to attach any social logins or existing wallets to that modular account (the widget for Dynamic has an 'add a wallet' button so hopefully it won't be too hard) in addition to the one (wallet or social) they signed up with. We need to be able to connect to the Avalanche Fuji testnet, a custom avalanche L1 ('mountfuji' in the foundry chains, I configured it in @customChains.ts ), the Scroll sepolia testnet, and probably  eth mainnet for good measure, as a baseline. We'll also need to be able to send USDC from one address to another on the L1, in terms of minimum requirements. I'd like to do a UI overhaul as well since we're using mostly scaffold-eth boilerplate, but I want to make sure I have that minimum functionality in place before I get too focused on UI changes. 

Final Codebase Context
It looks like you're aiming to integrate Dynamic's embedded wallets with Alchemy's Account Kit to create modular accounts during user signup, allowing users to attach social logins or existing wallets to their account. Additionally, you want to connect to multiple networks, including your custom Avalanche L1, and enable USDC transfers on your L1 network.
Here's how you can proceed:
1. Integrate Alchemy's Account Kit with Dynamic
While Dynamic's embedded wallets natively support ZeroDev for account abstraction, you can still integrate Alchemy's Account Kit into your project to create modular accounts. Here's how:
Use Dynamic's Headless SDK: Dynamic provides a headless SDK that allows you to customize authentication flows and integrate with other providers. By using the headless SDK, you can manage authentication with Dynamic while leveraging Account Kit for wallet creation.
Set Up Account Kit: Follow Alchemy's documentation to set up Account Kit in your React application. Since you're using Next.js, you can integrate Account Kit's React components or hooks.
Bash
Initialize Account Kit: In your _app.tsx or a suitable top-level component, initialize Account Kit.
Configure Dynamic and Account Kit Integration:
Since Dynamic's embedded wallets currently don't natively support Alchemy's Account Kit, you'll need to manage the wallet connection manually.
Listen for Authentication Events: Use Dynamic's SDK to listen for user authentication events. When a user signs up or logs in, initiate the Account Kit wallet creation process.
Attach Wallets to User Accounts: Utilize Dynamic's 'Add a wallet' feature to allow users to link existing wallets or social logins. You can customize the flow to associate the Account Kit modular account with the user's Dynamic profile.
Example of Handling Wallet Creation on Signup:
2. Configure Custom Networks
You need to connect to Avalanche Fuji testnet, your custom Avalanche L1 (mountfuji), Scroll Sepolia testnet, and Ethereum mainnet.
Update customChains.ts: Ensure that your custom chains are correctly defined.
Update scaffold.config.ts: Add the custom chains to your target networks.
Ensure Network Switching: Use wagmi and RainbowKit to handle network switching in your application. Update the chains configuration where necessary.
3. Enable USDC Transfers on Your L1 Network
To send USDC between addresses on your custom Avalanche L1 network:
Deploy USDC Contract on Your L1: If USDC isn't already deployed on your custom network, you'll need to deploy a USDC-equivalent ERC-20 token contract.
Interacting with the USDC Contract:
Add ABI and Address: Add the USDC contract ABI and deployed address to your application.
Create a Hook or Function to Send USDC:
Use the sendUSDC Function in Your Components:
4. Allow Users to Attach Social Logins or Existing Wallets
Dynamic supports adding multiple wallets to a user's account.
Leverage Dynamic's 'Add a Wallet' Feature:
Ensure that the 'Add a wallet' button is accessible in your application. When users click this button, they can connect additional wallets or social logins.
Customize Wallet Connections:
Handle Multiple Wallets: Use Dynamic's SDK to manage multiple wallets associated with a user account.
5. Test and Validate the Integration
Network Connectivity: Ensure that your application can switch between the different networks and interact with them appropriately.
User Flow: Test the signup process, modular account creation, and wallet connections to confirm everything works as expected.
6. Additional Considerations
Compatibility: Be aware that integrating Dynamic with Account Kit may have limitations since Dynamic's embedded wallets natively support ZeroDev. Thorough testing is essential.
Support and Documentation: Consult Dynamic's and Alchemy's documentation for any updates or detailed guides on integration.
Dynamic Documentation: Dynamic Docs \[1\]
Account Kit Documentation: Account Kit Docs \[2\]
7. Future Enhancements
UI Overhaul: Once the minimum functionality is in place, you can proceed to revamp the UI. Since you're using Scaffold-ETH, you can customize the components or replace them with your designs.
Error Handling and Security: Implement robust error handling, input validation, and security best practices, especially when dealing with wallets and financial transactions.
Conclusion
By integrating Dynamic with Alchemy's Account Kit and configuring your networks correctly, you can create a seamless user experience that allows modular account creation and management across multiple networks, including your custom Avalanche L1.

## social logins, customize multiple wallets:

    import { useDynamicContext } from '@dynamic-labs/sdk-react-core';

    const WalletManager = () => {
      const { user, setShowWalletForm } = useDynamicContext();

      const handleAddWallet = () => {
        setShowWalletForm(true);
      };

      return (
        <div>
          <h2>Connected Wallets</h2>
          <ul>
            {user.wallets.map((wallet) => (
              <li key={wallet.address}>{wallet.address}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <button onClick={handleAddWallet}>Add a Wallet</button>
        </div>
      );
    };

    ## send usdc function in components:

    import { useState } from 'react';
    import { useSendUSDC } from '../hooks/useSendUSDC';

    const SendUSDCForm = () => {
      const [recipient, setRecipient] = useState('');
      const [amount, setAmount] = useState('');
      const { sendUSDC } = useSendUSDC();

      const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        await sendUSDC(recipient, BigInt(amount));
      };

      return (
        <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
          <input
            type="text"
            placeholder="Recipient Address"
            value={recipient}
            onChange={(e) => setRecipient(e.target.value)}
          />
          <input
            type="number"
            placeholder="Amount"
            value={amount}
            onChange={(e) => setAmount(e.target.value)}
          />
          <button type="submit">Send USDC</button>
        </form>
      );
    };

    export default SendUSDCForm;

## hook for send usdc:

    import { useContractWrite } from 'wagmi';

    export const useSendUSDC = () => {
      const { writeAsync } = useContractWrite({
        address: '0xYourUSDCContractAddress',
        abi: usdcAbi,
        functionName: 'transfer',
      });

      const sendUSDC = async (to: string, amount: bigint) => {
        await writeAsync({
          args: [to, amount],
        });
      };

      return { sendUSDC };
    };
## add abi

    // packages/nextjs/generated/deployedContracts.ts
    export const deployedContracts = {
      mountfuji: {
        USDC: {
          address: '0xYourUSDCContractAddress',
          abi: [/* ... USDC ABI ... */],
        },
      },
    };
contract is deployed so no worries there

## dont forget to update config w more networks

  // packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts
  import { mountfuji, fuji, scrollSepolia } from './utils/customChains';
  import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains';

  const scaffoldConfig = {
    targetNetworks: [mountfuji, fuji, scrollSepolia, mainnet],
    // ... other configurations
  };
